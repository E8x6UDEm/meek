NAME
----
meek-client - The meek client transport plugin

SYNOPSIS
--------
**meek-client** **--url**=__URL__ **--front**=__DOMAIN__ [__OPTIONS__]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
meek-client is a transport plugin for Tor that encodes a stream as a
sequence of HTTP requests and responses. It is usually run with the
**--url** and **--front** options. The **--url** option controls what
URL requests are made to; the web server at that URL should be
configured to forward requests to a meek-server somewhere. The
**--front** option is for domain name camouflage: The domain name in the
URL is replaced by the front domain before the request is made, but the
Host header inside the HTTP request still points to the original domain.
The idea is to front through a domain that is not blocked to a domain
that is blocked.

Configuration for meek-client usually appears in a torrc file. Most user
configuration can happen either through SOCKS args (i.e., args on a
Bridge line) or through command line options. SOCKS args take precedence
per-connection over command line options. For example, this
configuration using SOCKS args:
----
Bridge meek 0.0.2.0:1 url=https://meek-reflect.appspot.com/ front=www.google.com
ClientTransportPlugin meek exec ./meek-client
----
is the same as this one using command line options:
----
Bridge meek 0.0.2.0:1
ClientTransportPlugin meek exec ./meek-client --url=https://meek-reflect.appspot.com/ --front=www.google.com
----
The advantage of SOCKS args is that multiple Bridge lines can have different
configurations.

The **--helper** option prevents meek-client from doing any network
operations itself. Rather, it will send all requests through a browser
extension, which must be set up separately.

OPTIONS
-------
**--front**=__DOMAIN__::
    Front domain name. The **front** SOCKS arg overrides the command
    line.

**--helper**=__ADDRESS__::
    Address of HTTP helper browser extension. For example,
    **--helper 127.0.0.1:7000**.

**--proxy**=__URL__::
    URL of upstream proxy. If not given, the proxy URL may be taken from the
    The **proxy** SOCKS arg overrides the command line. For
    example, **--proxy=http://localhost:8787/**.

**--log**=__FILENAME__::
    Name of a file to write log messages to (default stderr).

**--url**=__URL__::
    URL to correspond with. The domain part of the URL may be modified
    by **--front**.

**-h**, **--help**::
    Display a help message and exit.
